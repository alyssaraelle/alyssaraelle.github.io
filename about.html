        <div class="description">
          <p>In my undergraduate years, I studied business and economics. I
            studied business to better understand the facets that make up a
            company. I studied economics to better understand the environment
            where companies and people survive. Since graduating from university,
            I’ve worked with nine startups and one large corporate company. I’ve
            helped seven startups with their branding, pitching, and research for
            launching. I’ve helped two with their foundational metrics and
            marketing. I’ve helped one with its product development and
            engineering roadmap. I’ve provided pricing strategy, competitive
            analysis, and managed an entire communications calendar from content
            to optimization. At all ten places I worked with incredibly smart and
            compassionate people. I learned a lot about what does and
            does not make a company successful, but I’m not done yet.</p>
