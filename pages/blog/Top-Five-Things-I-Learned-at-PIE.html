          <p>Five things I learned at the Portland Incubator Experiment (PIE)
            that could benefit<br> any early-stage startup:</p>
          <br>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Don't wait to execute.</strong><br><br><p>The PIE space held very
              little art. This may be why I remember
              one piece of art so clearly. It was two sentences painted
              hurriedly onto a white background - “Move fast. Break things.”
              This was the PIE mantra. This was the comment made to any startup
              founder that was getting stuck in the details. This was the answer
              to getting from idea to execution. My first lesson - if you
              have an idea for a company or project you think could be
              successful, don’t wait to execute. Build it. Test it.
              Break it. Repeat until you know whether or not there’s a viable
              market.</p></li>
              <br>

            <li><strong>Don’t skip the mission statement. Don’t skip the company
              values.</strong><br><br><p>The mission statement and company values
              are key elements in defining your company’s
              voice, messaging, and culture, and these things help determine the
              success of your company. People are drawn to people with integrity
              and conviction. People shy away from inconsistency and
              indecisiveness. This is true for people and companies.</p></li>
              <br>

            <li><strong>Keep your pitch simple, stupid, and know your audience.</strong>
              <br><br><p>There’s nothing more important than getting your pitch right
              when you’re in the early stages of a startup. These are the lines
              that explain who you are, what value you’re bringing to your
              customers, why they’re going to love it, and when you’re going to
              prove it. Like a resume
              catered to different roles, a pitch may need to be crafted for
              different people. For example, if you have a high-tech product and
              are pitching to a room full of investors with little to no
              technological background, your pitch may include less technical
              details than it would when given to a room full of developers. In either scenario,
              don’t overdo it. Make sure there can be no doubt about what your
              product does and why it will be a success.</p></li>
              <br>

            <li><strong>Never stop getting to know your customer.</strong><br><br><p>Yes,
              you’ve got to do some research up front to make sure the people
              who like your photo app are really females in their late 20s-30s
              and not males in their 40s-50s, but you can’t stop there. You have
              to continue putting in the time to understand your base so that
              you don’t miss the trends or the opportunities for new value.</p></li>
              <br>

            <li><strong>Don’t be afraid to ask for help, and don’t forget to
              repay your debts.</strong><br><br><p>Your journey isn’t going to
              be smooth sailing. You’re going to
              encounter roadblocks that you can’t solve, and you’re going to
              have to reach out for help.  It’s absolutely
              fine to reach out for help, but don’t forget to say thank you -
              immediately and then once more when your head is above water.</p></li>
