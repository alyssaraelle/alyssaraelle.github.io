          <h4>What is it?</h4>
          <p>Orchestrate was the first startup to be accepted into PIE with a
            multimillion dollar, Series A investment. Orchestrate connected
            multiple NoSQL databases under one API, allowing developers to
            efficiently and cost-effectively build modern applications.<br><br>Orchestrate
            was a pioneer of its product and faced the challenges of a pioneer.
            Nonetheless, Orchestrateâ€™s value was seen by many larger companies
            in its field and was ultimately acquired by CenturyLink Cloud in
            2015. CenturyLink Cloud added Orchestrate to its wider portfolio of
            enterprise cloud products.</p>
          <h4>My experience.</h4>
          <p>I joined Orchestrate as part of the founding team. I was put in
            charge of our analytics, meaning I decided what metrics were
            important when it came to tracking the success of the company.<br><br>I
            researched best practices for reporting and tracking metrics, and
            I researched the best tools for the job. I led market research such
            as usability studies and persona development. I did competitive
            analysis that was used to guide the product roadmap, the future
            strategy, and the sales team. I was put in charge of the entire
            communications calendar and the creation of its content. I provided
            strategy for different teams and departments on how to improve
            their metrics. I owned
            the data-driven culture that the company was built on from start to
            finish.</p>
